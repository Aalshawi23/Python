 # Hat and Ball Guessing Game ðŸŽ©ðŸŽ±

Hi! Iâ€™m Alaa, and this is one of my first Python projects.  
Itâ€™s a fun little console game where you try to guess which hat hides the ball (`O`).  

## How to Play
1. The game shuffles three hats â€” only one hides the ball (`O`).  
2. Pick a number: 0, 1, or 2.  
3. The game will tell you if you guessed correctly.  
4. You can play again as many times as you like â€” itâ€™s super fun!  

## Features I Loved Building
- Interactive console game that actually responds to you ðŸŽ‰  
- Uses functions, loops, and conditionals â€” all beginner-friendly Python concepts  
- Modular code structure thatâ€™s easy to read and expand  
- Teaches how to combine multiple functions and user input
